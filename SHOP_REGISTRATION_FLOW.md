# 🏪 Unified Shop Registration Flow

## Overview
This document outlines the unified shop registration flow that consolidates all shop owner functionality into a single dashboard experience, eliminating confusion between multiple dashboard views.

## 🔄 **Unified Flow**

### **1. Shop Owner Registration Process**
```
1. User signs up → Creates account with 'shop_admin' role
2. User goes to /shop-registration → Fills out shop details
3. User submits → Redirected to /dashboard (shows pending status)
4. ShopBuddy super admin reviews application on /admin dashboard
5. Once approved → Shop owner automatically gets access to full dashboard
6. Shop owner can now manage products, staff, and track analytics
```

### **2. User Role Routing**
- **Super Admin** (`super_admin`) → `/admin` (ShopBuddy admin dashboard)
- **Shop Admin** (`shop_admin`) → `/dashboard` (Unified shop dashboard)
- **Staff** (`staff`) → `/dashboard` (Unified shop dashboard)
- **Customer** (`customer`) → `/customer-portal` (Customer portal)

### **3. Single Dashboard Approach**
- **`/admin`** → ShopBuddy super admin dashboard (manages all shops)
- **`/dashboard`** → Unified dashboard (handles both pending and approved shop status)
- **No more confusion** between multiple dashboard routes

## 🎯 **Key Changes Implemented**

### **2. Updated Routing Logic**
